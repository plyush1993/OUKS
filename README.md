# OUKS - omics untargeted key scripts
R based open-source collection of scripts called OUKS (Omics Untargeted Key Script) providing comprehensive nine step LC-MS untargeted metabolomic profiling data processing: 
1) experimental design and sample randomization; 
2) peaks integration and time alignment; 
3) missing value imputation (MVI) and artifacts removal; 
4) signal drift correction and batch effect removal;
5) feature annotation and tentative identification by database search; 
6) peaks filtering for quality checking and accounting of technical variation; 
7) data normalization and adjusting of biological variation; 
8) peaks grouping and molecular features clustering; 
9) statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.
