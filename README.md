R based open-source collection of scripts called OUKS (Omics Untargeted Key Script) providing comprehensive nine step LC-MS untargeted metabolomic profiling data processing: 
1) experimental design and sample randomization; 
2) peaks integration and time alignment; 
3) missing value imputation (MVI) and artifacts removal; 
4) signal drift correction and batch effect removal;
5) feature annotation and tentative identification by database search; 
6) peaks filtering for quality checking and accounting of technical variation; 
7) data normalization and adjusting of biological variation; 
8) peaks grouping and molecular features clustering; 
9) statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

- Instruction and introduction into the OUKS software tool is provided by Basic tutorial file. Session info and installed packages are listed in corresponding files.
- Scripts (with comments, notes and references) are stored in Scripts folder at a previously defined order along with code for figures construction.
- MS2 spectra for selected potential biomrkers of bladder cancer are stored in mzXML format at corresponding folder.
- Datasets in .csv and other files (.RData, .R) are available for reproducibility from corresponding folders. Files descriptions are provived by Roadmap file.

The only requirements are to be familiar with the basic syntax of the R language, PC with Internet connection and Windows OS (desirable), RStudio and R (â‰¥ 4.0.0).
